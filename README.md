# Just Hammers

Add hammers to the game that are able to mine in a 3x3, 3x3x3, 5x5x3 and finally a 5x5x5! They're pretty awesome.

## Features

- Mines blocks
- Breaks blocks
- Pushes blocks over
- Move blocks! Get out my way
- Has a stern talking to the blocks to make them stop blocking your way
- Yeets blocks
- Fires blocks into the void...

### But for real...

- Iron, Gold, Diamond, Netherite Hammers
- Has tiers of all of the above that increase the area of affect. Starting at 3x3x1 all the way up to 5x5x5. Durability scales with the tiers
- Hammers will not break! They will get to 1 durability and can be repaired in an anvil

## Issues

If you find any issues with the mod, please report them on the projects [Github issues page here](https://github.com/ErrorMikey/JustHammers/issues).

### Known issues that need to be addressed

- Vein miner like mods can be used in conjunction with the hammers
- The AOF can sometimes shift in a strange way due to the way we calculate block breaking and look vectors, this may need addressing

## Textures

Textures provided by [Rid](https://github.com/Ridanisaurus/)! Amazing as always!

## TODO

- [x] Add tool tips to tell people what each hammer does
- [ ] Add support for rendering larger block outline whilst holding hammer
- [ ] Add breaking animation to blocks visible that are being broken
- [ ] Possible upgrades to add things like smelting
